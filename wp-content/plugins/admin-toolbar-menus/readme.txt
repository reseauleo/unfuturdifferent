Super simple to use, just like building any other menu in WordPress using the menus page.<br />
No settings, just 'plug and play'.

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:

= via FTP =
1. Upload folder `admin-toolbar-menus` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the menus page under 'Appearance' > 'Menus' to create your new menus

Or

= via wp-admin =

2. Click 'Activate Plugin'
3. Visit the menus page under 'Appearance' > 'Menus' to create your new menus


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this display menus to admin only or everyone? =
The menus created will be visible to anyone logged in.

= Can you make it show only to admins? =
You could quite easily but you would need to know a little php. You simply need to add a conditional statement to the plugin to make sure only the admin user role can see the menus.

= Do you have to use all 3 menus? =
Nope! If you don't assign a menu to the locations, they simply won't show up.


== Screenshots ==
1. 3 new toolbar menu locations added to your existing locations.
2. You can see the new locations below when creating your menus.
3. Example main toolbar menu with multi level flyout *(you can also see how it was created)*

== Translations ==
* English - default, always included
* *Your translation? - [Just send it in](mailto:wp@benbodhi.com)*

*Note:* This plugin is localized/translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/).


== Additional Info ==
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** This is something that I have found super useful when it comes to customizing WordPress. I have been writing custom menus for quite a while and realised there is not much out there like this. No more code snippets, copy pasting or including files, simply install the plugin and away you go using the built in WordPress menus. A simple but powerful plugin to give you more customization powers over the admin toolbar.


== Future Features ==
* More power over menu locations with options to pick which locations you want to use and the menu order in relation to existing WordPress menus.
* Options page to remove other standard toolbar menu items.<br />*(you can uncomment these in the code now if you're keen ;)*
* Ability to change the WordPress "Howdy" welcome message
